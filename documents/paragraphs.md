# Paragraphs

## Write a great opening sentence

The opening sentence is the most important sentence of any paragraph. Busy readers focus on opening sentences and
sometimes skip over subsequent sentences. Therefore, focus your writing energy on opening sentences.

Good opening sentences establish the paragraph's central point. For example, the following paragraph features an
effective opening sentence:

> A loop runs the same block of code multiple times. For example, suppose you wrote a block of code that detected
> whether an input line ended with a period. To evaluate a million input lines, create a loop that runs a million times.

The preceding opening sentence establishes the theme of the paragraph as an introduction to loops. By contrast, the
following opening sentence sends readers in the wrong direction:

> A block of code is any set of contiguous code within the same function. For example, suppose you wrote a block of code
> that detected whether an input line ended with a period. To evaluate a million input lines, create a loop that runs a
> million times.

### Examples

BAD:
> The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the squares of both legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of
> the hypotenuse. The k-means clustering algorithm relies on the Pythagorean Theorem to measure distances. By contrast,
> the k-median clustering algorithm relies on the Manhattan Distance.

This opening sentence is _defective_ because it implies that the paragraph will focus on the Pythagorean Theorem. In
fact, the paragraph's focus is actually clustering algorithms. The following would be a more effective opening sentence:

GOOD:
> Different clustering algorithms measure distances differently.

Note: Effective opening sentences can take many forms. That is, not all great paragraphs start with a sentence that
states the theme. Starting a paragraph with a rhetorical question, for example, can engage readers.

## Focus each paragraph on a single topic

A paragraph should represent an independent unit of logic. Restrict each paragraph to the current topic. Don't describe
what will happen in a future topic or what happened in a past topic. When revising, ruthlessly delete (or move to
another paragraph) any sentence that doesn't directly relate to the current topic.

## Don't make paragraphs too long or too short

Long paragraphs are visually intimidating. _Very_ long paragraphs form a dreaded "wall of text" that readers ignore.
Readers generally welcome paragraphs containing three to five sentences, but will avoid paragraphs containing more than
about seven sentences. When revising, consider dividing very long paragraphs into two separate paragraphs.

Conversely, don't make paragraphs too short. If your document contains plenty of one-sentence paragraphs, your
organization is faulty. Seek ways to combine those one-sentence paragraphs into cohesive multi-sentence paragraphs or
possibly into lists.

## Answer what, why, and how

Good paragraphs answer the following three questions:

1. _What_ are you trying to tell your reader?
2. _Why_ is it important for the reader to know this?
3. _How_ should the reader use this knowledge? Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?

For example, the following paragraph answers what, why, and how:

> The garp() function returns the delta between a dataset's mean and median. Many people believe unquestioningly that a
> mean always holds the truth. However, a mean is easily influenced by a few very large or very small data points. Call
> garp() to help determine whether a few very large or very small data points are influencing the mean too much. A
> relatively small garp() value suggests that the mean is more meaningful than when the garp() value is relatively high.
