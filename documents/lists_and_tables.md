# Lists and tables

## Start numbered list items with imperative verbs

Consider starting all items in a numbered list with an imperative verb. An *imperative verb* is a command, such as *open* or *start*. For example, notice how all of the items in the following parallel numbered list begin with an imperative verb:

1. Download the Frambus app from Google Play or iTunes.
2. Configure the Frambus app's settings.
3. Start the Frambus app.

## Punctuate items appropriately

Start each list item with a capital letter. For example:

- Loops
- Conditionals
- Variable declarations

If a list item is a sentence, use appropriate sentence-ending punctuation. For example:

1. Open the program.
2. Click the settings icon.

## Create useful tables

Consider the following guidelines when creating tables:

- Label each column with a meaningful header. Don't make readers guess what each column holds.
- Avoid putting too much text into a table cell. If a table cell holds more than two sentences, ask yourself whether that information belongs in some other format.
- Although different columns can hold different types of data, strive for parallelism *within* individual columns. For instance, the cells within a particular table column should not be a mixture of numerical data and famous circus performers.

## Introduce each list and table

Introduce each list and table with a sentence that tells readers what the list or table represents. In other words, give the list or table context. Terminate the introductory sentence with a colon rather than a period.

Although not a requirement, we recommend putting the word *following* into the introductory sentence. For example, consider the following introductory sentences:

> The following list identifies key performance parameters:
> Take the following steps to install the Frambus package:
> The following table summarizes our product's features against our key competitors' features:
