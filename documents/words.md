## Define new or unfamiliar terms

Recognize terms that might be unfamiliar to some or all of your target audience.

- If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation. (Don't reinvent the wheel.)
- If your document is introducing the term, define the term. If your document is introducing many terms, collect the
  definitions into a glossary.

### It and they

The following pronouns cause the most confusion in technical documentation:

- It
- They, them, and their

For example, in the following sentence, does _It_ refer to Python or to C++?

> Python is interpreted, while C++ is compiled. _It_ has an almost cult-like following.

As another example, what does _their_ refer to in the following sentence?

> Be careful when using Frambus or Carambola with HoobyScooby or BoiseFram because a bug in _their_ core may cause
> accidental mass unfriending.

### This and that

Consider two additional problem pronouns:

- This
- That

For example, in the following ambiguous sentence, _This_ could refer to the user ID, to running the process, or to all
of these:

> Running the process configures permissions and generates a user ID. _This_ lets users authenticate to the app.

To help readers, avoid using _this_ or _that_ in ways where it's not clear what they refer to. Use either of the
following tactics to clarify ambiguous uses of _this_ and _that_:

- Replace _this_ or _that_ with the appropriate noun.
- Place a noun immediately after _this_ or _that_.

Substitute or add explicit terms as needed, as in the following rewrites of the example's second sentence:

> This user ID lets users authenticate.
>
> The process of configuring permissions lets users authenticate.
>
> The combination of permissions and a user ID lets users authenticate.
