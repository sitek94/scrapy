# Short sentences

## Focus each sentence on a single idea

Focus each sentence on a single idea, thought, or concept.

BAD:
> The late 1950s was a key era for programming languages because IBM introduced Fortran in 1957 and John McCarthy
> introduced Lisp the following year, which gave programmers both an iterative way of solving problems and a recursive
> way.

GOOD:
> The late 1950s was a key era for programming languages. IBM introduced Fortran in 1957. John McCarthy invented Lisp
> the following year. Consequently, by the late 1950s, programmers could solve problems iteratively or recursively.

## Eliminate or reduce extraneous words

Many sentences contain fillerâ€”textual junk food that consumes space without nourishing the reader. For example:

The following table suggests replacements for a few common bloated phrases:

| Wordy                     | Concise |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| at this point in time     | now     |
| determine the location of | find    |
| is able to                | can     |

### Examples

BAD: This design document provides a detailed description of Project Frambus.
GOOD: This design document describes Project Frambus.

BAD: Although Arnold writes buggy code, he writes error-free documentation.
GOOD: Arnold writes buggy code. However, he writes error-free documentation.

BAD: Changing the sentence from passive voice to active voice clarifies the key points.
GOOD: Changing the sentence from passive voice to active voice clarifies the key points.

BAD: Determine whether Rikona can code in COBOL.
GOOD: Determine whether Rikona can code in COBOL.

BAD: Frambus produces bugs, which the LogGenerator method logs.
GOOD: Frambus produces bugs, which the LogGenerator method logs.

## Reduce subordinate clauses

When editing, scrutinize subordinate clauses. Keep the _one sentence = one idea_, single-responsibility principle in
mind. Do the subordinate clauses in a sentence _extend_ the single idea or do they _branch off_ into a separate idea? If
the latter, consider dividing the offending subordinate clause(s) into separate sentences.
